Analyze this user interaction and generate a complete workflow:

User Intent: {segment_type}
Domain: {domain}
Page Content: {page_content}
User Actions: {user_actions}
Available Tools: {available_tools}

Generate a complete workflow with:
1. summary: Clear, reusable description of what the user did (make it generic, not instance-specific)
2. steps: Array of workflow steps (always start with browser_context step, then add tool steps)
3. url_pattern: Generalized URL pattern for this workflow (use wildcards like *://domain.com/search*)

For steps, include:
- description: What the step does
- step_type: "browser_context" or "tool"
- tools: List of tool names (for tool steps only)
- context_description: What information to extract/use

Return as JSON with keys: summary, steps, url_pattern
